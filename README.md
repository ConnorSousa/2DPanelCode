# 2DPanelCode
This is my attempt to set up my first repository. This is where I will be keeping my 2D code as I learn about potential flow theory, GitHub, XCode, C++, and many a maths. Most of the files included here will probably look like 5th grader work. This is because I currently have no idea what I am doing and am mostly mashing buttons until someting happens.
